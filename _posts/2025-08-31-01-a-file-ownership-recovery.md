<p>In Windows, <strong>file permissions</strong> can prevent one account from accessing files owned by another. There are situations where gaining access is necessary, and if you have <strong>administrator privileges</strong>, you can “take ownership” of a file or folder to gain full access.</p>

<p>This exercise focused on performing <strong>ownership recovery</strong> as a standard user with elevated privileges. The key takeaway is that file ownership is controlled by <strong>NTFS metadata</strong>, not the Registry. Tools like <code>takeown</code>, <code>icacls</code>, or PowerShell are the supported methods for managing ownership.</p>

<p>Understanding how ownership works is critical for <strong>system security and administration</strong>. Proper access control ensures sensitive data is protected, while knowing how to correctly recover ownership helps maintain operational continuity.</p>
