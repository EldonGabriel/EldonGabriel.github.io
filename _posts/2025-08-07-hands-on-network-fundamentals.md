## Hands-On Network Fundamentals: OSI, TCP/IP, and VPNs in Practice

The more you learn network fundamentals, the easier cybersecurity gets. Completing the Network Fundamentals section of the MSAF course was not just a checklist item—it was a milestone in my journey. This module involved hands-on labs that applied theory to real-world scenarios, mirroring the exact skills required by cybersecurity professionals.

### Grasping the Theoretical Underpinnings

I began by building a strong foundation through research on the **OSI and TCP/IP models**:

- **OSI model:** A 7-layer framework for understanding network communication.  
- **TCP/IP model:** The practical 4-layer model powering the Internet.  

Understanding each layer is essential for spotting vulnerabilities, analyzing traffic, and implementing security controls.

Next, I researched **common networking hardware** used in enterprise networks:

- **Hubs:** “Dumb” devices that broadcast traffic to all ports.  
- **Switches:** Targeted traffic delivery, more efficient than hubs.  
- **Routers:** Manage traffic between networks.  
- **Firewalls:** Protect sensitive data by controlling access and segmenting networks.  

### Putting Knowledge into Practice: Static & Dynamic Network Design

To test my knowledge, I designed a visual network with **Draw.io** for a 100-employee business. Every PC, switch, and server placement built the network; adding firewalls and a DMZ protected it. The result: a complete network diagram with secure segmentation and proper security controls.

The final challenge involved **Cisco Packet Tracer** to create a dynamic network for a 1,000-employee organization. Tasks included:

- Building WANs, LANs, and VLANs.  
- Configuring **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **Network Address Translation (NAT)**.  
- Establishing an **IPSec VPN tunnel**, troubleshooting crypto parameters, and resolving command-line quirks.  

This exercise took over **10 hours** of intensive hands-on work and led me to create a troubleshooting guide for the final diagram.

#### Key Tasks Completed

- Researched the **OSI and TCP/IP models** and cybersecurity implications.  
- Researched common **networking hardware** for enterprise networks.  
- Designed a **static network diagram** using Draw.io.  
- Built a **dynamic network** in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Configured **LANs, VLANs, ACLs, NAT, and IPSec VPNs**.

### Conclusion

Textbook learning alone does not prepare you for advanced hands-on exercises like this. I gained practical, real-world skills and produced a complete two-part network project suitable for my cybersecurity portfolio.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Hands-on experience designing static and dynamic networks.  
- Learned to set up **LANs, VLANs, ACLs, NAT, and VPNs**.  
- Built **troubleshooting and documentation skills** under real-world conditions.  
- Applied **OSI and TCP/IP theory** directly to practical scenarios.  
- Produced a portfolio-ready two-part network project.
