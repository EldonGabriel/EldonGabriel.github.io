The more you learn network fundamentals, the easier cybersecurity gets. Completing the Network Fundamentals section of the MSAF course was not just a checklist item—it was a milestone in my journey. This module involved hands-on labs that applied theory to real-world scenarios, mirroring the exact skills required by cybersecurity professionals.

<center><h2>Grasping the Theoretical Underpinnings</h2></center>

I began by building a strong foundation through research on the **OSI and TCP/IP models**:

<ul>
  <li><strong>OSI model:</strong> A 7-layer framework for understanding network communication.</li>
  <li><strong>TCP/IP model:</strong> The practical 4-layer model powering the Internet.</li>
</ul> 

Understanding each layer is essential for spotting vulnerabilities, analyzing traffic, and implementing security controls.

Next, I researched **common networking hardware** used in enterprise networks:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hubs:</strong> “Dumb” devices that broadcast traffic to all ports.</li>
  <li><strong>Switches:</strong> Targeted traffic delivery, more efficient than hubs.</li>
  <li><strong>Routers:</strong> Manage traffic between networks.</li>
  <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Protect sensitive data by controlling access and segmenting networks</li>
</ul> 

<center><h2>Putting Knowledge into Practice: Static & Dynamic Network Design</h2></center>

To test my knowledge, I designed a visual network with **Draw.io** for a 100-employee business. Every PC, switch, and server placement built the network; adding firewalls and a DMZ protected it. The result: a complete network diagram with secure segmentation and proper security controls.

The final challenge involved **Cisco Packet Tracer** to create a dynamic network for a 1,000-employee organization. Tasks included:

<p><strong>Tasks included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Building WANs, LANs, and VLANs.</li>
  <li>Configuring **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **Network Address Translation (NAT)**.</li>
  <li>Establishing an **IPSec VPN tunnel**, troubleshooting crypto parameters, and resolving command-line quirks.</li>
</ul>

This exercise took over **10 hours** of intensive hands-on work and led me to create a troubleshooting guide for the final diagram.

<p><strong>Key Tasks Completed</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Researched the **OSI and TCP/IP models** and cybersecurity implications.</li>
  <li>Researched common **networking hardware** for enterprise networks.</li>
  <li>Designed a **static network diagram** using Draw.io.</li>
  <li>Built a **dynamic network** in Cisco Packet Tracer.</li>
  <li>Configured **LANs, VLANs, ACLs, NAT, and IPSec VPNs**.</li>
</ul>

<center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>

Textbook learning alone does not prepare you for advanced hands-on exercises like this. I gained practical, real-world skills and produced a complete two-part network project suitable for my cybersecurity portfolio.

<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hands-on experience designing static and dynamic networks.</li>
  <li>Learned to set up **LANs, VLANs, ACLs, NAT, and VPNs**.</li>
  <li>Built **troubleshooting and documentation skills** under real-world conditions.</li>
  <li>Applied **OSI and TCP/IP theory** directly to practical scenarios.</li>
  <li>Produced a portfolio-ready two-part network project.</li>
</ul>
