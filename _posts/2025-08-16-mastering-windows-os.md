## Mastering Windows OS â€“ Security and System Hardening

Today, I want to share how I recently completed a project on Windows security hardening. This report covers best practices for the Windows operating system. This was a hands-on exercise from my **MCSI** exercises. I looked into system configuration, network protection, and registry security.  

Many people use Windows, making it a frequent target for hackers. Knowing how to secure it helps protect computers and is an important part of any cybersecurity strategy.

## Key Principles Learned

- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Users and systems should only have the access needed for their tasks. Regular users should not have admin rights.  
- **Centralized Management:** GPOs and Active Directory apply security settings to all devices consistently.  
- **Attack Surface Reduction:** Removing unnecessary roles, features, and services lowers potential entry points for attackers.  
- **Network Segmentation:** VLANs split a network into isolated sections, containing attacks and preventing threats from spreading.

## Cybersecurity Applications

- **Threat Modeling:** Hardening Windows systems helps identify vulnerabilities, such as overly open firewall rules.  
- **Risk Management:** Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication reduce the risk of account compromise.  
- **Incident Response:** Properly configured systems provide clear logs for SOC teams to trace and respond to attacks.

## Alignment with Industry Frameworks

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Security hardening covers access control, vulnerabilities, and data protection.  
- **Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC):** Standard security baselines support compliance and improve risk management.  
- **Cybersecurity Roles:** This knowledge is essential for SysAdmins, Security Engineers, and Auditors.

## Next Steps

I will apply these principles in upcoming labs and document my hands-on results in my portfolio. Proactive security measures are key to protecting both organizational and personal data.
