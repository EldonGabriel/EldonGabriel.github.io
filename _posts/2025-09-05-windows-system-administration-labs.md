# Mastering Windows System Administration: 11 Independent Labs  

As part of my cybersecurity and system administration journey, I designed 11 independent labs focused on Windows 10. Each lab highlights one tool or feature and shows how it applies to real administration work. I built and tested everything inside an AWS-hosted Windows 10 VM for hands-on cloud experience.  

The goal of these labs is simple: build practical skills in system maintenance, troubleshooting, and secure administration. Below is a summary of the labs with direct demo links.

## Final Thoughts  
These 11 labs give a practical look at Windows administration from the ground up. The focus is on building repeatable skills that carry over into IT operations and cybersecurity work. Each lab was built independently, recorded, and documented — proving not just theory but practice.  

This project shows how everyday Windows tools can be turned into professional exercises that strengthen troubleshooting, security, and system management skills.
