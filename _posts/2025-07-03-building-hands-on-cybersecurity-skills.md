My cybersecurity journey began with a mindset: donâ€™t just collect theoryâ€”build skills that work in the real world.
Thatâ€™s exactly what I found when I enrolled in the **MICS â€“ Introduction to Cyber Security** course through MossÃ© Cyber Security Institute. After completing **_39 practical exercises_**, Iâ€™ve officially earned:

These certificates are more than titlesâ€”theyâ€™re earned through real labs, real tools, and real problem-solving. The MICS course helped me build foundational skills across multiple domains of cybersecurity and gave me the confidence to move into more advanced operations and system-level thinking.

<center><h2>What I Gained from MICS</h2></center>

The MICS experience was **100% hands-on**. There were no pre-written answersâ€”only guided learning through testing, research, and trial-and-error. This approach helped me develop real-world fluency in key areas like:

### ðŸ”¹ OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Created covert accounts and mindmaps from social media data  
- Used `dnsdumpster.com`, Shodan, and `dnstwist.py` to detect asset exposure and phishing campaigns  

### ðŸ”¹ Vulnerability & Penetration Testing
- Performed **TCP/UDP** scans using **Nmap**  
- Ran web app scans using **Burp Suite Spider** and **Intruder**  
- Used **OpenVAS** to identify vulnerabilities in a virtual environment  

### ðŸ”¹ Threat Hunting & Malware Detection
- Built **custom YARA rules** for identifying binaries and strings  
- Documented and tested rules to match professional standards  

### ðŸ”¹ Digital Forensics
- Used **Dumpzilla** to analyze browser artifacts  
- Performed static malware analysis using **PEStudio** 

These exercises were supported by a focus on **professional writing and technical research**, sharpening both my technical and communication skillsâ€”critical for any analyst or engineer in the field.

<center><h2>Why I Chose to Enroll in MSAF</h2></center>

After earning my Level 3 certification and completing the MICS course, I knew it was time to dive deeper. Thatâ€™s why I enrolled in **MSAF â€“ System Administration Fundamentals**, a course designed to build mastery in the systems that power and secure enterprise environments.

ðŸ“„ Iâ€™ve attached my official **Confirmation of Enrolment** from MossÃ© Cyber Security Institute, verifying that Iâ€™m actively enrolled and progressing through the course.

<center><h2>What MSAF Will Help Me Master</h2></center>

The MSAF course goes beyond conceptsâ€”it teaches how to **build, secure, and recover real systems**. Hereâ€™s a preview of what Iâ€™m working on:

### ðŸ”¹ Virtualization
- Deploying virtual machines (VMs) in VirtualBox, VMware, GCP, and AWS  
- Creating snapshots and restoring safe system states  
- Installing and configuring VMware ESXi and managing via vSphere  

### ðŸ”¹ Windows & Linux Hardening
- Creating and deploying GPOs to enforce password policies, exploit protection, UAC, and patch management  
- Locking down user rights, folders, and remote access  
- Securing _Windows Defender_ and configuring SMB and WinRM  

### ðŸ”¹ Network Security & Firewalls
- Designing network architectures in Draw.io and Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Creating and testing firewall rules with pfSense  
- Secure VPN tunneling and traffic filtering  

### ðŸ”¹ Backup & Recovery
- Using Duplicati and Windows tools to build backup and restoration workflows  
- Backing up and restoring Active Directory  
- Simulating server migrations from on-prem to cloud  

All of this work contributes to my **public portfolio**, showcasing not just theoryâ€”but evidence of capability.

<center><h2>Why This Matters</h2></center>

The cyber workforce doesnâ€™t need more paper certsâ€”it needs people who can **solve problems under pressure**.
By completing MICS and enrolling in MSAF, Iâ€™m reinforcing a **portfolio-first mindset** backed by tools, techniques, and repeatable results. 

From **YARA rules** to **GPO enforcement**, every step I take is documented and demonstrated for employers, collaborators, and mentors to see.
Whether Iâ€™m threat hunting, writing policy, or hardening a Windows server, my goal is the same: **deliver real, tested value**.


<center><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></center>

MCSIâ€™s approach to cybersecurity training is unlike anything Iâ€™ve experienced. With every lab and report, Iâ€™m building the skills that matter in the field.
