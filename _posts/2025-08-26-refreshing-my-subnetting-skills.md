While reviewing my old handwritten notes from my ISC² CC exam prep, I found a section where I had written out subnet ranges for Class C networks. It reminded me of late-night study sessions and the challenge of memorizing network and host address ranges.

I realized this was a good chance to refresh my memory and practice subnetting in a hands-on way. I decided to turn those notes into a full, structured report—a reference I could use for future labs, exercises, and real-world projects.

## REPORT – IP Subnetting Fundamentals – v1.0.0

**Focus:** Class C subnets /25–/29  

This report includes a complete table of subnet addresses, usable hosts, and broadcast addresses for the 192.168.1.0/24 network. The math follows standard formulas:

- **Subnet increment** = 2^(number of host bits)  
- **Usable hosts per subnet** = 2^(number of host bits) - 2  

Each subnet now has a network address, first and last usable hosts, and broadcast address—making it easy to reference when designing networks or completing exercises.

## Handwritten Notes

I wanted to include my original ISC² CC exam prep notes. These images show how I manually calculated and wrote out the subnets.

## Key Takeaways

- Reviewing old notes can spark useful exercises and refresh critical skills.  
- Subnetting isn’t just memorization; structured practice helps reinforce understanding.  
- Creating formal documentation from practice exercises builds knowledge and portfolio assets.
