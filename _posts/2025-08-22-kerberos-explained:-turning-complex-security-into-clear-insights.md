<center><h4>Tickets, Not Passwords: The Elegant Security System Behind Your Single Sign On</h4></center>
<p>As a Cybersecurity Technician, I know the value of tangible proof of skill. An in-depth report on the <strong>Kerberos authentication protocol</strong> titled <a href="https://github.com/EldonGabriel/eldongabriel.github.io/blob/main/assets/reports/REPORT%20%E2%80%93%20Kerberos%20Authentication%20Protocol%20%E2%80%93%20v1.0.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"<strong>REPORT – Kerberos Authentication Protocol – v1.0.0"</strong></a> became a cornerstone of my portfolio. Creating this report taught me crucial lessons about technical communication—just as important as technical knowledge itself.</p>

  <center><h3>Foundational Knowledge</h3></center>
  <p>The Kerberos report began as a graded assignment for the "Computer Security and Systems Management Specialization" course at the University of Colorado. In the "Windows Server Management and Security" module, I had to explain Kerberos in depth. Scoring 500/500 points confirmed my strong grasp of the topic and boosted my confidence.</p>
  <p>The report breaks down the core problem Kerberos solves: the historical vulnerability of sending plain-text passwords over networks. It explains how Kerberos uses a trusted third party—the <strong>Key Distribution Center (KDC)</strong>—to issue encrypted, time-limited tickets rather than exposing credentials. This principle is fundamental to modern enterprise security.</p>

  <center><h3>Lessons Learned</h3></center>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clarity is King:</strong> I clearly defined terms like <strong>Authentication Server (AS)</strong>, <strong>Ticket Granting Server (TGS)</strong>, <strong>TGT</strong>, and <strong>ST</strong>. I also explained the <em>why</em> behind each component, such as how the TGT enables multiple service tickets without re-authentication—the basis for <strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Visuals are Powerful:</strong> Diagrams of the Kerberos authentication process helped viewers quickly understand complex, multi-step processes. This shows I can translate theory into clear, easy-to-follow visuals.</li>
    <li><strong>The “So What?” Factor:</strong> My report highlights practical relevance, including Kerberos use in <strong>Microsoft Active Directory</strong>, access to shared drives, internal applications, and the importance of time synchronization to prevent <strong>replay attacks</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Awareness of Vulnerabilities:</strong> I included sections on threats like <strong>Kerberoasting</strong>, <strong>Golden Ticket</strong>, and <strong>Silver Ticket</strong> attacks, demonstrating a full understanding of both strengths and risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <center><h3>Final Thoughts</h3></center>
  <p>The Kerberos report is more than a document—it’s a foundational piece of my cybersecurity portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to learn complex systems, apply them practically, and communicate them clearly. Most importantly, it reflects my dedication to building a strong portfolio and my commitment to breaking into the cybersecurity industry.</p>
